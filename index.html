        <h2>Schrödinger's Cat</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Schrodingers_cat.svg/330px-Schrodingers_cat.svg.png" alt="schrodinger cat" class="picture">

        <p>Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935, though the idea originated from Albert Einstein. It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the
          Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a hypothetical cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead, a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result
          of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur.</p>

        <p>The thought experiment is also often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly in situations involving the measurement problem. Schrödinger coined the term Verschränkung (entanglement) in
          the course of developing the thought experiment.

        <h2>Aristotle’s Metaphysics</h2>

        <img src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/042119-27-Ancient-History-Philosophy-Science-Biology-Aristotle-Greek-Greece-768x402.jpg" alt="aristotle" class="picture" width="100%">

        <p>Aristotle himself described his subject matter in a variety of ways: as ‘first philosophy’, or ‘the study of being qua being’, or ‘wisdom’, or ‘theology’. A comment on these descriptions will help to clarify Aristotle’s topic.</p>

        <p>In Metaphysics Α.1, Aristotle says that “all men suppose what is called wisdom (sophia) to deal with the first causes (aitia) and the principles (archai) of things” (981b28), and it is these causes and principles that he proposes to
          study
          in this work. It is his customary practice to begin an inquiry by reviewing the opinions previously held by others, and that is what he does here, as Book Α continues with a history of the thought of his predecessors about causes and
          principles.</p>

        <p>These causes and principles are clearly the subject matter of what he calls ‘first philosophy’. But this does not mean the branch of philosophy that should be studied first. Rather, it concerns issues that are in some sense the most
          fundamental or at the highest level of generality. Aristotle distinguished between things that are “better known to us” and things that are “better known in themselves,” and maintained that we should begin our study of a given topic with
          things better known to us and arrive ultimately at an understanding of things better known in themselves. The principles studied by ‘first philosophy’ may seem very general and abstract, but they are, according to Aristotle, better known
          in
          themselves, however remote they may seem from the world of ordinary experience. Still, since they are to be studied only by one who has already studied nature (which is the subject matter of the Physics), they are quite appropriately
          described as coming “after the Physics.”</p>

        <p>Aristotle’s description ‘the study of being qua being’ is frequently and easily misunderstood, for it seems to suggest that there is a single (albeit special) subject matter—being qua being—that is under investigation. But Aristotle’s
          description does not involve two things—(1) a study and (2) a subject matter (being qua being)—for he did not think that there is any such subject matter as ‘being qua being’. Rather, his description involves three things: (1) a study,
          (2)
          a subject matter (being), and (3) a manner in which the subject matter is studied (qua being).</p>
